**JavaScript, p5.js**

Procedurally programed videogame created in a group of four. Practice your mouse tracking skills with this point and click aiming game. Includes targets with multiple point levels, shrinking and moving targets, and negative targets (wait till they dissapear instead of clicking!). Multiple game modes for different play styles: In Easy, Medium, and Hard levels, the size of the targets is changed based on difficulty -> try to click as many targets in the allowed time!. Survival mode -> players have three lives, try to be as accurate as possible to get the highest score before you die!
